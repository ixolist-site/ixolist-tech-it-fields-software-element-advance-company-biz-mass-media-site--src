new-title: The concept of “digital organization” may appear in Russian legislation
new-text: In his address at the Fin Hype Law 2024 financial club conference, Deputy Minister of Finance Ivan Chebeskov proposed legalizing the concept of a digital entity or decentralized autonomous organization.<br>He elaborated that this status could be assigned to a regular limited liability company if the ownership rights to its shares are recorded in information systems.<br> According to the deputy minister, there are already several information systems in Russia issuing digital financial assets. Ivan Chebeskov suggested that a corporate agreement could also be executed within such a system, but in the form of a smart contract.<br> The creation of a digital entity would eliminate the need for notarization of transactions, as they would be registered on the operational platform. Additionally, all organization registries and reporting would be maintained on the platform. <br> Ivan Chebeskov highlighted that this could significantly streamline business operations.
